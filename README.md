# Movies-Recommendation-System-
Welcome to the Movies Recommendation System! This repository contains the implementation of a content-based recommendation system designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.
## Overview
Content-based recommendation systems recommend items to users by comparing the content of items to a userâ€™s profile. In this project, we utilize various movie features such as genre, director, cast, and plot summaries to create recommendations tailored to each user's taste.
## Features

Feature Extraction: Utilizes movie metadata such as genre, cast, director, and plot to create item profiles.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates the similarity between movies based on their features.
